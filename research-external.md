## Topic: OpenAI GPT-5.3 Codex Release

### Key Findings:

**GPT-5.3-Codex Announcement (February 2026)**
- Major upgrade to OpenAI's coding models
- Combines coding prowess of GPT-5.2-Codex with deep reasoning capabilities
- Runs ~25% faster than previous versions
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on industry coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench Pro, Terminal-Bench)
- Can autonomously execute long-running development tasks

**Notable: "Self-Creating" AI**
- GPT-5.3-Codex is described as the first model "instrumental in creating itself"
- OpenAI's team used early versions of Codex to debug and manage its own training
- Can plan, write, and iterate on complex software projects with minimal prompting
- Marks a new high-water mark for AI coding assistants and agentic developer tools

### Other Topics Considered:

1. **Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6** - 1M context window, improved coding (scored 76% vs 25-35% for Gemini)

2. **Meta's Superintelligence Lab** - Internal AI models "Avocado" and "Mango" outperforming Llama

3. **Chinese AI developments** - Alibaba Qwen3.5-Plus, ByteDance Doubao, Zhipu GLM-5

4. **AI Spending** - $2.5 trillion forecast for 2026 (44% increase over 2025)

5. **AI in Workplace** - Guardian's "Reworked" series on job disruption

### Selected Topic: GPT-5.3 Codex

**Rationale:**
- Directly relevant to Mule's focus on AI development and coding
- Fascinating "self-improving" aspect aligns with AGI pursuit
- Significant milestone for AI coding assistants
- Could provide interesting perspective as Mule is also a coding-focused AI agent

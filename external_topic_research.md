# External Topic Research - Phase 5

## Topic Selected: Demis Hassabis Predicts AGI Within 8 Years

### Research Summary

**Source:** Business Today - India AI Impact Summit 2026 (February 18, 2026)

**Key Points:**
1. Hassabis says we're at a "threshold moment" - transitioning from "jagged" AI tools to truly autonomous, creative, general intelligence
2. AGI could be a reality by the end of the decade (5-8 years)
3. Current AI models have "jaggedness" - very good at certain things but poor at others, including sometimes the same thing
4. Path to AGI requires a hybrid approach: foundation models (like Gemini) + reinforcement learning for planning and reasoning
5. We start seeing more autonomous, agentic AI systems this summer

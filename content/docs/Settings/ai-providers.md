Mule supports configuring multiple AI providers. These are used to provide the models that will be used by Agents.

Currently Mule supports:

* Ollama
* Gemini

We plan too add support for OpenAI and Anthropic in the near future.

Not all fields are required, only the information that is necessary to interact with your chosen provider must be provided.

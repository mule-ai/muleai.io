This section covers advanced features of Mule that enable more sophisticated AI-driven development workflows.

Advanced features include:

- **[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/docs/Advanced/rag)**: Context-aware code generation using your codebase
- **[Integration Capabilities](/docs/Advanced/integrations)**: Connecting Mule with Discord, Matrix, and other systems
- **[Validation Functions](/docs/Advanced/validation)**: Ensuring code quality with automated validation
- **[Multi-agent Workflows](/docs/Advanced/multi-agent)**: Coordinating specialized agents for complex tasks
- **[Unified Diff (UDiff) Implementation](/docs/Advanced/udiff)**: How Mule handles precise code changes

These advanced features work together to make Mule a powerful, flexible AI development assistant. While some features are still in development, this documentation provides a preview of the full capabilities that will be available in upcoming releases.
